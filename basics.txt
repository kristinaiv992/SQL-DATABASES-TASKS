WHAT IS A DATABASE?
======================
A large amount of information stored in a computer system in such a way it can be easily looked or changed!
*TYPES OF DATABASES:

CREATE AND WORKING WITH TABLES
What is the difference between Clustered and Non-Clustered Indexes in SQL Server?
Differences between clustered and non-clustered indexes.
	1. 
There can be only one clustered index per table. However, you can create multiple non-clustered indexes on a single table.
	2. 
Clustered indexes only sort tables. Therefore, they do not consume extra storage. Non-clustered indexes are stored in a separate place from the actual table claiming more storage space.
	3. 
Clustered indexes are faster than non-clustered indexes since they don’t involve any extra lookup step.


What is the difference between Pimary Key and Foreign Key?
In SQL Server, there are two keys - primary key and foreign key which seems identical, but actually both are different in features and behaviors.

Primary Key
ForeignKey

Primary key uniquely identify a record in the table.
Foreign key is a field in the table that is primary key in another table.

Primary Key can't accept null values.
Foreign key can accept multiple null value.

By default, Primary key is clustered index and data in the database table is physically organized in the sequence of clustered index.
Foreign key do not automatically create an index, clustered or non-clustered. You can manually create an index on foreign key.

We can have only one Primary key in a table.
We can have more than one foreign key in a table.
